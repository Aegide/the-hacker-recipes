This project is aimed at providing technical guides on various hacking topics. The most advanced topics are Active Directory and Web services. Other topics will be added. The ultimate goal is centralize all hacking techniques :eyes:

Cheatsheets are huge resources, but they sometimes lack simplicity or on the contrary they don't give enough context or explanation. **This is not a cheatsheets project**. Everything here will be verified, tested, and not only copy-pasted from I don't know where.

This project is not the only one around focusing on providing ethical hacking guides. You should also take a look at [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/welcome/readme) and [ired.team](https://www.ired.team/).

Keep in mind that these guides are maintained by non-omniscient security enthusiasts in their spare time. You will probably find things missing or mistakes and writing all this takes time.

:mega: Please feel free to contribute, give feedback/suggestions or reach out to me on Twitter ([@\_nwodtuhs](https://twitter.com/\_nwodtuhs)), Discord (@nwodtuhs), IRL or whatever you feel appropriate.
